# 1011 Sequence Detector using Mealy and Moore FSM

This project implements and verifies a 1011 sequence detector using both
Mealy and Moore Finite State Machines in Verilog.

The objective is to compare architectural behavior and verify correctness
using self-checking testbenches with pass/fail reporting.

## Design Description

- **Mealy FSM**
  - Output depends on current state and input
  - Output asserted in the same clock cycle

- **Moore FSM**
  - Output depends only on current state
  - Output asserted one clock cycle later

Overlapping sequence detection is supported in both designs.

- [Mealy FSM Design](design/seq_1011_mealy.v)
- [Moore FSM Design](design/seq_1011_moore.v)

## Self-Checking Testbenches

The testbenches automatically verify functionality and report PASS/FAIL
using assertion-style checks.
